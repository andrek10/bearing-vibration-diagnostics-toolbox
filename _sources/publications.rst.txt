Thesis
------

The pyvib module was built during my PhD education at University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway.
Because of the open-source community, I was able to produce most of my thesis with LaTeX, Inkscape and most importantly Python.
In addition, the PhD thesis was funded by the public: Ministry of Education in Norway.
In this spirit, I release the pyvib module to the public.
