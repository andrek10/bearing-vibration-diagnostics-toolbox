# VibPy
Vibration analysis toolbox in Python for bearing fault diagnostics.

VibPy is a Python module created during my PhD in Mechatronics at the University of Agder in Grimstad, Norway.

This module is tested and verified to work using the Anacoda distribution on Windows 10 and Ubuntu with python 3.6.

## Requirements:
Python modules
- NumPy
- PyFFTW
- Numba
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
  
## Installation
Move PyVib folder into project folder or site-packages (or use symbolic link)

Windows users may get PyFFTW from
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
